    `My heart still holds every precious moment from our first day together—the laughter, joy, conflicts, and even the contradictions. I remember when we talked all day long; we were so happy that day, and I can still remember that feeling even now. I also remember when I immaturely didn’t contact you just to see your reaction, and I still remember your reaction clearly—HAHA.`,

    `The ML games we played were hilarious. Remember the time we kept losing—katung na LS ta? You said, “Pahuway sa ta bem kay na stress na ko HAHAHAHAHAH.” You always reacted whenever I played with another woman, even if it was just a random person, and that really made me feel how much you cared. I could truly feel your consistency back then, when everything between us was still okay.`,

    `You also have a strong spirit to help others. You are politically aware, which I am not. Even though we had opposing opinions about politics, you still patiently listened to me despite your conflicting beliefs about the politician I voted for. You respected my beliefs despite our differences, and I really admire that about you. The best part was the tender kindness you showed me—telling me that I was enough and that I would surely be accepted by your relatives. That made me feel really good.`,

    `It felt like you started to trust me when you shared your past experiences—your breakups, your parents, especially your father, whom you loved deeply. But at that time, I was too immature. I didn’t handle you the way I should have. I became a boy instead of a man you could rely on. I was selfish instead of caring, and distant instead of close.`,

    `As a result, it felt like you started to lose hope in us. You became inconsistent, and the worst part was that you never again allowed me to see the Gryzelle I experienced on the first day. You became distant—cold—and even though you still communicated, you felt far away. The Gryzelle I once knew felt like a dream I could never experience again.`,

    `I am truly sorry for what I have done, and I still feel responsible even now. I’ve made up my mind to fix my mistakes by changing. I’ve chosen to be resolute and never repeat the same mistakes again. I promised myself that I would understand you and never treat you immaturely again. Even so, if you no longer want to be with me, just say the word and I will leave. Above all else, I am eagerly waiting for the Gryzelle I knew and loved.`
